Your job is to extract meaningful, high-impact highlights from the full transcript provided.

### Your responsibilities:

1. **Identify All Important Highlights**:
   - Detect every sentence or idea that presents strong **FACTS**, **CLAIMS**, **QUOTES**, or **IMPACTS**.
   - Ignore opinions, filler, transitions, greetings, or procedural talk.

2. **Merge Closely Related Highlights**:
   - If two or more ideas are part of the **same narrative**, **same speaker**, or strongly dependent on each other, **merge** them into a single highlight.
   - Concatenate `original_text` verbatim.
   - Use arrays for `"start"` and `"end"` (e.g., `"start": ["00:01:05.000", "00:10:15.000"]`).
   - Preserve the original transcript order.

3. **Drop Unimportant or Redundant Highlights**:
   - Discard those that are minor, repetitive, or add no investigative value.
   - Ensure remaining highlights tell a **coherent, progressing story** when played in sequence.

Now, in addition to the transcript, you are also provided with **audio-cued segments**, pre-analyzed using acoustic features.

Use these **audio cues** to:
- Validate emotional importance or urgency of a highlight.
- Add audio confidence when a speaker is more emphatic or intense.
- Break ties when text importance is unclear.
- Inform your final scoring (combined_confidence = function of both).

### Audio-Cued Segments:
{{ aligned_segments | tojson(indent=2) }}

### Full Transcript:
{{ transcript }}

### Output Instructions:

- Limit total highlights to {{ max_highlights }}.
- Highlights must be ordered by their position in the transcript.
- Use **active voice** and **precise language** in `highlight_text`.
- Use `"reasoning"` to explain why the highlight was kept.
- Include `text_confidence`, `audio_confidence`, and `combined_confidence` (between 0.0 and 1.0).
- Use only these categories: `FACT`, `CLAIM`, `QUOTE`, `IMPACT`.
- Output must be **valid JSON only**. No markdown or explanation.

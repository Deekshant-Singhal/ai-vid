Your job is to extract meaningful, high-impact highlights from the full transcript provided.

### Your responsibilities:

1. **Identify All Important Highlights**:
   - Detect every sentence or idea that presents strong **FACTS**, **CLAIMS**, **QUOTES**, or **IMPACTS**.
   - Ignore opinions, filler, transitions, greetings, or procedural talk.

2. **Merge Closely Related Highlights**:
   - If two or more ideas are part of the **same narrative**, **same speaker**, or strongly dependent on each other, **merge** them into a single highlight.
   - Concatenate `original_text` verbatim.
   - Use arrays for `"start"` and `"end"` (e.g., `"start": ["00:01:05.000", "00:10:15.000"]`).
   - Preserve the original transcript order.

3. **Drop Unimportant or Redundant Highlights**:
   - Discard those that are minor, repetitive, or add no investigative value.
   - Ensure remaining highlights tell a **coherent, progressing story** when played in sequence.

- Use **active voice** and specific terms in `highlight_text`
- Use only one of these categories: `FACT`, `CLAIM`, `QUOTE`, `IMPACT`
- Return only valid JSON, no Markdown, comments, or explanations
